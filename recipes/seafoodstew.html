                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Step 1: Prepare the Seafood: If using frozen seafood, thaw according to package instructions. If fresh, clean the seafood well. Shell shrimp if necessary and slice squid into rings.</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Sauté Vegetables: Heat a large pot over medium heat. Add a tablespoon of olive oil. Once hot, add the onions, carrots, and potatoes. Sauté until the vegetables start to soften, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Step 3: Add Garlic and Herbs: Stir in the minced garlic, bay leaf, and dried thyme. Cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
                    <li>Step 4: Mix in Tomatoes and Broth: Pour in the diced tomatoes and vegetable broth. Stir well to combine everything. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low.</li>
                    <li>Step 5: Simmer: Cover the pot and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.</li>
                    <li>Step 6: Add Seafood: Gently fold in the seafood. Be careful not to overcook the seafood; it should remain firm and juicy. Cook for about 3-5 minutes, depending on the size of the pieces.</li>
                    <li>Step 7: Season: Taste the stew and season with salt and pepper as needed.</li>
                    <li>Step 8: Serve: Ladle the stew into bowls and garnish with chopped fresh parsley before serving.</li>
