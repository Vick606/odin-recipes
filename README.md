# odin-recipes
Hey there, 
This is part of my Odin project intro sessions 
Focused on implementing learned concepts by building a basic recipe website. 

The interface obviously won't be that pretty. I'm just implementing a few html chops!

Will revisit later to integrate CSS etc. 

By the end of the project we'll have enjoyed an instruction-guided demonstration of various basic but essential html skills.
