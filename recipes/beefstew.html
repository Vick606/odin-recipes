            <li>Kosher salt and cracked black pepper to taste</li>
            <li> ¼ cup all-purpose flour </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
            <li>3 cups chopped onion</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>3 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>2 cups dry red wine</li>
            <li>2 cups beef broth, or more as needed </li>
            <li>Others as needed: chopped carrots, 1 cup fresh peas, chopped rosemary, potatoes, Worcestershire sauce</li>


        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1: Season the Beef: Toss the beef cubes in a bowl with a generous amount of kosher salt and cracked black pepper. Dredge the seasoned beef in the all-purpose flour, shaking off any excess.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Brown the Beef: Heat the canola oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add half of the beef cubes and cook until browned on all sides. Remove the beef to a plate and set aside. Repeat with the remaining beef cubes.</li>
            <li>Step 3: Cook the Onions and Garlic: In the same pot, add the chopped onions and cook until softened. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Step 4: Deglaze with Wine: Pour in the dry red wine, scraping the bottom of the pot to release any browned bits. Let the wine reduce by half.</li>
            <li>Step 5: Add Spices and Tomato Paste: Stir in the smoked paprika, dried thyme, dried rosemary, herbes de Provence, and tomato paste. Mix well to coat the onions and garlic.</li>
            <li>Step 6: Return the Beef: Add the beef back to the pot along with the Worcestershire sauce, bay leaves, and beef broth. Stir well to combine.</li>
            <li>Step 7: Add Vegetables: Fold in the carrots, potatoes, and peas. Ensure all the ingredients are submerged in the liquid.</li>
            <li>Step 8: Simmer: Cover the pot and place it in the oven at 325°F (163°C). Cook for about 2 hours, or until the beef and vegetables are tender.</li>
            <li>Step 9: Adjust Seasoning: Taste the stew and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, pepper, fresh thyme, or fresh rosemary if desired.</li>
            <li>Step 10: Serve: Ladle the stew into bowls and serve hot. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired.</li>
        </ol>
