        <p>
            Here is my favorite Pumpkin pancake recipe.
            Nutritious and quick pumpkin pancakes from scratch. 
            Developed for my pumpkin-loving son.
            Serve warm with hot Kericho gold tea.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>What you'll need to make these pancakes:</p>

        <ul>

            <li>White sugar - desired</li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons baking powder </li>

            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>

            <li>Step 2: Whisk milk, pumpkin, egg, and oil together in a bowl.
